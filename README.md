# shoe-size-finder
A Python script using Selenium Webdriver, Beautiful Soup, SMTPlib, and Schedule that checks the available sizes of a specific shoe on the TJ MAXX website every day at 7am. Once my size is back in stock, it will send me an email notification.

**Update**: On November 9, two days after writing this program, I was notified that my size was back in stock!
